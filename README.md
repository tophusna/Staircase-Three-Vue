# vue-threejs-demo

This is a Proof-Of-Concept integration of Vue.js and Three.js.   I have converted the Three.js [Trackball Control Example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=cont#misc_controls_trackball) to a Vue/Vuex application and added some additional UI sugar on top.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
